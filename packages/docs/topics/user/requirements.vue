        {{app.name}} is a PWA (Progressive Web App), which means that you can start
        using {{app.name}} as soon you open <a :href="vendor.website">{{app.name}}</a>
        in the browser. You can change to an app-like experience, by adding {{app.name}}
        to your homescreen, using the <em>Add to homescreen</em> option in Chrom(e/ium).
        The {{app.name}} web app can be installed on the following platforms with a
        pre-installed Chrom(e/ium) browser: Android, ChromeOS, Linux, OSX and Windows.

    <h2>Earbuds/Headset</h2>
    <p>

        Audio calls require only a microphone. Most audio problems are
        caused by incorrect audio settings and bad microphone quality.
        The microphone on your laptop or webcam may sound to your caller,
        as if you're talking from out of a bathtub. For optimal communication
        with your callee, it is important to use a decent microphone!<br/><br/>

        Bluetooth earbuds/headsets give you space to move while you're on a call,
        but please notice that Bluetooth headset configuration could lead to more
        configuration issues. USB headsets have less room for error. USB and Bluetooth
        headsets will both show up as separate device in {{app.name}}'s device configuration.
        Headsets or earbuds with a Jack use the standard audio device on your computer.
    </p>

    <h2>Camera</h2>
    <p>
        To make video calls, you need to have a camera connected to your computer.
        Mobile phones typically come with higher quality cameras, while most
        builtin laptop cameras are low quality. Using a higher quality camera
        makes communication between you and your callees easier.
